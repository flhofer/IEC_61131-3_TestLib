Test library changes required to run on legacy S7 systems


TestCase
-----

* No pointers, changed all arrays and relative pointers to entry id's
* No global constants. Size constants are now part of TestCase, and must be instantiated in some cases to permit IF comparison
* Bit access through constants. requires mapping to an instance DB
* SysMemSet needs FB as pointers must be in I/O only and allocated somewhere, i.e., instance DB i/O or global DB only. This is a limitation of SCL
* Functions can not pass parameters beyond base types to functions. You need to pass them to a temp variable first
* The main program must be implemented as FB instantiated in a DB instantiation, or a function accessing a global DB. However, becayse sysmemset is a FB, it can not be run from inside a function

Global Constants
--------------
Older versions (Simatic Manager) do not support global constants. The constants must thus be redefined for every test-case FB, or the programm migrated to TIA (which supports global user constants)
